					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the timing of animations is incredibly important. Making sure to adjust timing based on factors such as size and distance was also something new for me. I also learned that the device you are designing for plays a part in the animation speeds.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> All the visual elements were helpful to better understand the concepts. Without the animations, I would feel pretty lost in understanding the article. I particularly liked their good vs bad examples.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
