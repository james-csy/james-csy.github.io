							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a lot about how we perceive visual elements. It was interesting to learn how we tend to fill in the gaps of what we see and can recognise objects with parts missing. I also learned that there are number of ways to signal groups in a design such as shape, spacing, and colour.</p>
