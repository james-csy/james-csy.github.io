                            <p> My favourite design was the Add to Cart interaction for the Nike's. The initial swipe transition was so satisfying and made it look like the user was pulling the page. Additionally, changing the size of the shoe's image alongside the scrolling of the size was a neat touch. I also like how the color change had a live effect on the shoe model. It made the experience very playful and exciting.</p>
